Earlier this month, the first on-set image was released, teasing an adventure through Chinatown. Thanks to the John Wick Twitter account, we have some new casting announcements, featuring some well known names. Asia Kate Dillon (Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Brotherhood of the Wolf), Anjelica Huston (The Addams Family), and Jason Mantzoukas (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place) have all joined the cast. <br>On top of that, Halle Berry (X-Men) also announced she will be joining the movie, the actor posting an ominous message onto Twitter, implying she will likely be joining in the hunt for John Wick. <br>Along with Keanu Reeves, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and Lance Reddick will all be returning for the sequel. <br>Speaking last year with The Independent, director Chad Stahelski hinting the upcoming sequel may be John Wick’s final outing. “We are going to put in something about the High Table, how that all works,” he said. “We’re going to put in something about where John comes from, and where he wants to go. I don’t want to say too much more, but it will be a nice completion to Mr Wick’s journey.” <br>Asked whether the film would complete a trilogy, Stahelski said “In our minds, yes” adding that a TV show – which has now been confirmed to centre on The Continental – is also in development. John Wick: Chapter 3 reaches cinemas 17 May 2019.",
